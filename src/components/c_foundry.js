      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        When E. P. Sedgwick (1867-1935) and John Sherwin (1859-1921) organized
        the Chicago Hardware Foundry Co. in the spring of 1897, it was under
        somewhat rebellious circumstances. Up until the previous year, both men
        were in the employ of an already flourishing North Chicago factory: the
        Chicago Hardware Manufacturing Co. Sedgwick, at age 30, had worked his
        way up to plant superintendent, while Sherwin, at 38, was the foreman.

        After experiencing some creative differences with the ownership of that
        firm, however, Sedgwick and Sherwin asked if they could lease some
        factory space of their own to concentrate on small grey iron castings.
        Their bosses said “sure”—so like I said, it was merely a somewhat
        rebellious beginning. Nonetheless, it didn’t take long for this small
        side venture to turn into a fully realized, independent business, as
        Sedgwick (as secretary/treasurer) and Sherwin (as president) soon built
        their own plant directly across the street from the existing one, and
        gave their new company a nearly indistinguishable name from their
        neighbors: dubbing it the Chicago Hardware Foundry Co.
      </p>
      <p>
        As their business boomed, E. P. Sedgwick and John Sherwin became
        luminaries of North Chicago, with each taking a turn as mayor of the
        small town while still running operations over at the foundry. After
        World War I, the aging tycoons also rediscovered some of their youthful
        gutsiness, launching a new business called the Sani Products
        Company—initially as a joint venture with the Marietta MFG Co. of
        Pennsylvania. The headquarters for Sani was located at 209 W. Randolph
        St. in regular Chicago, and an additional plant was eventually opened in
        Elkhart, Indiana.

      <p>
        In 1969, the company was put under the control of Illinco Corp., a New
        York holding company, and the diminishing North Chicago plant was shut
        down and liquidated, with surviving equipment transported up to another
        foundry in Racine, Wisconsin. A 1969 ad promoting a public auction of
        leftover tools and machines from the North Chicago foundry can be seen
        below.

      <p>
        The Sullivan Company, am Illinois furniture manufacturer, took ownership
        of the Racine plant and the remaining Chicago Hardware Foundry Company
        shares in 1971, but Sullivan itself was then subsequently sold in 1980.

      <p>
        As best we can tell, some bastardized version of the Chicago Hardware
        Foundry Co. continued to exist as late as 1988, with production in that
        same Racine foundry. When the company relocated to Grayslake, IL, that
        same year, they were promptly sued and defeated by the state of
        Wisconsin for having sent “excessive discharges of nickel and other
        toxic metals into Racine’s wastewater treatment system.” Coincidentally,
        1988 was also the year that a major chemical fire at the foundry’s
        former North Chicago works essentially leveled the complex and any
        remaining treasure trove of cast iron relics that might have been hidden
        in the walls.
