          <Typography> The Birmingham Stove & Range Company was a manufacturer which produced
          cast iron wood stoves and cookware in Birmingham from 1902 to 1993.</Typography>

          The business was founded in 1902 as the Alabama Manufacturing Company
          with Samuel Jones as president. He built the foundry in North
          Birmingham to produce hollow cookware for the Atlanta Stove Company of
          Atlanta, Georgia. Jones originally leased 80 convicts from the State
          of Alabama as laborers. The firm acquired a number of foundry patterns
          from a failed business in 1909 and was reorganized as the Birmingham
          Stove & Range Company with B. Harry Hartsfield as vice-president and
          general manager and S. T. Price as secretary/treasurer.
        </p>

        <p>
          The foundry was damaged by fire in 1915 and reopened on a new site on
          Huntsville Road at 27th Avenue North in Collegeville. Samuel Jones
          died in 1930 and was succeeded as president by his brother, Bolling
          Jones Sr. In 1933 Samuel Jones' son, Bolling Jones Jr took over as
          president of both the Birmingham Stove & Range Company and the Atlanta
          Stove Works, then wholly owned by a holding company, Republic Stove.

          Under new financial laws in 1938 the company was restructured under
          the name of the Atlanta Stove Works Inc. (doing business as the
          Birmingham Stove & Range Company). The Atlanta foundry closed in 1957
          and manufacturing of both lines was consolidated at the Birmingham
          plant. Output was increased greatly with the debut of "DISAMATIC"
          mould-making machines in 1966 and sales took off with the introduction
          of a divided "corn bread skillet" in 1967.

          Saunders Jones II succeeded his father as president in 1973. He led
          the creation of the A & B Parts Division which manufactured
          replacement parts for ASW and BS&R products. Oscar Wisely, head of the
          Wisely Group, purchased controlling interest in the company in 1984,
          installing himself as president and demoting Saunders Jones II to
          vice-president. Two years later he sold the company's gas heater, wood
          and coal stove patterns and jigs to Martin Industries while keeping
          the cookware manufacturing business operating in Birmingham as the A &
          B Foundry.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1991 the foundry closed and licensed its cookware lines to Robinson
          Iron and contracted with Lodge Cast Iron to distribute its products.
          The arrangement with Robinson Iron was short-lived, and A & B
          eventually sold its remaining patterns to Lodge, including the popular
          "Sportsman Grill" and corn bread skillet.
        </p>

        <p>
          On January 6, 1993 the firm filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection
          and sold its "Sportsman Grill" design to Lodge Cast Iron. Its articles
          of incorporation were revoked in 1995. The foundry site was sold to
          KMAC Services in 1996 and currently operates as Evolutia, which
          markets salvaged and recycled building products.
