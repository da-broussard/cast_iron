      <h3>Early Years</h3>
      <p>
        The Seldon-Griswold Manufacturing Company was founded in Erie,
        Pennsylvania, in 1865 by Matthew Griswold (born 6 June 1833) and his
        cousins, the brothers J.C. and Samuel Selden.
      </p>
      <p>
        The company made separable butt hinges and other light hardware products
        at a building called the "Butt Factory" beside the Erie Extension Canal.
        Other products were stovepipe dampers, thimbles, and other stove
        furniture.
      </p>
      <h3>Growth</h3>
      <p>
        In the 1870s, Griswold began to manufacture skillets, pots, grinding
        mills and waffle irons. The company was renamed Selden & Griswold
        Manufacturing Company in 1873. In 1884 Matthew Griswold bought out the
        interests of the Selden family. The next year there was a fire, and the
        factory had to be rebuilt. In 1887 the company was reorganized and
        chartered as the Griswold Manufacturing Company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Matthew Griswold was twice elected as a Republican to Congress, sitting
        from March 1891 to March 1893, and from March 1895 to 1897. He died on
        19 May 1919.His son, Matthew Griswold Junior, was president from 1905 to
        1914
      </p>
      <p>
        The Griswold Plaza in Erie is named in honor of his efforts to develop
        downtown Erie with a post office and railway station. Matthew Junior's
        brother Marvin was president from 1914 until his death in 1926, during a
        period of rapid growth
      </p>
      <p>
        Griswold began making tobacco cutters in 1883. In 1884 Matthew Griswold
        patented and manufactured a wheeled spittoon. Over the years that
        followed the company added products such as kettles, Dutch ovens,
        roasters, a grid iron and other various pots and pans. Cast-iron
        stovetop waffle irons were one of the company's earliest and most
        successful products, manufactured into the 1930s
      </p>
      <p>
        The company gained a reputation for quality cast-iron products,
        particularly cookware, which were sold world-wide. The first aluminum
        cookware was a tea kettle made around 1893. In 1903 the company moved to
        new premises at 12th and Raspberry Streets. In the 1920s Griswold began
        producing enameled items, and in the 1930s had added electrical items to
        their product line. Griswold acquired many patents over the years
      </p>
      <p>
        Miss Etta Moses worked for Griswold for over 50 years. She was given the
        job of handling letters asking for advice on using the company's
        products. In the 1920s she began publishing recipes and advice on
        cooking with cast iron using the pen name of "Aunt Ellen"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Aunt Ellen" was the author of Griswold's "Booklet on Waterless
        Cooking", given free to purchasers of the Tite-Top Dutch Oven. Her
        picture appeared in advertisements for the cook pot in journals such as
        Good Housekeeping.
      </p>
      <p>
        A 1928 advertisement in Good Housekeeping described the Griswold
        Electric Waffle Baker, and invited readers to write to Aunt Ellen for
        details on making the waffle cream pie. Every day she dealt with a large
        correspondence from housewives asking for advice. She died in 1948
      </p>
      <h3>Dissolution</h3>
      <p>
        By the 1940s, the company was in financial difficulty, facing
        competition from manufacturers of more modern products while struggling
        with internal labor disputes and declining quality. Family members
        continued to own and run the company until 1946, when Ely Griswold sold
        it to a New York investment group and retired. In March 1957,
        McGraw-Edison of Chicago, Illinois, acquired Griswold Manufacturing.
        Later that year the Griswold brand and housewares division were sold to
        the Wagner Manufacturing Company of Sidney, Ohio. The plant in Erie,
        Pennsylvania, was closed in December 1957. When the factory closed,
        sixty people were laid off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Randall Corporation, the owner of Wagner since 1952, sold both companies
        to Textron in 1959. Textron sold them to the General Housewares
        corporation in 1969. General Housewares made products under the Griswold
        and Wagner brands until 1999, when it closed and the manufacturing and
        brands were acquired by American Culinary Corporation of Willoughby,
        Ohio Classic cast-iron Griswold cookware is now prized by
        collectors. The main reason the items are collectible is that they
        have distinctive brand markings. Collectors should be wary of
        reproductions, which generally have a grainy finish and uneven and
        blurred lettering. :"One is considered fortunate nowadays if by
        chance one of these iron utensils is handed down to them from the second
        to the third generation. It is on account of these wonderful Cast Iron
        utensils that you have such fond recollections of the rich, juicy steaks
        and chops your grandmother used to serve." â€“ Aunt Ellen
