      <h3>Foundation</h3>
      <p>
        The Wagner Manufacturing Company was founded by the brothers Milton M.
        and Bernard P. Wagner in Sidney, Shelby County, Ohio. The architect
        Joseph Altenbach started construction of the Wagner manufacturing
        complex in 1890. He was a friend of the family head Mathias Wagner, and
        was responsible for many of the major buildings in Sidney during that
        period. The company was incorporated in 1891. The principal owners
        were Bernard, Milton, Louis, and William Wagner. The brothers were
        joined by R.O. Bingham, who had in the past worked at the Marion Stove
        Works and the Sidney Manufacturing Company, who became superintendent of
        the company.

      <h3>Operation</h3>
      <p>
        At first producing only cast-iron products, the company added
        nickel-plated ware in 1892.In 1894 Wagner was one of the first to
        make aluminum cookware. The company acquired their competitor Sidney
        Hollow Ware from Phillip Smith in 1897. A third brother, William H.
        Wagner, joined the company to run this operation. In 1903 Sidney Hollow
        Ware was sold back to Smith. By 1913 Wagner was distributing its
        products globally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wagner grew into a major manufacturer of cast iron and aluminum
        products, selling in the US and Europe. In addition to cookware it
        manufactured furnace grates, feed troughs, rubbish burners, kettles, and
        chemists' mortars. The company won many awards, and at one point had a
        60% market share in cookware. Brand names included Wagner Ware,
        National, Long Life, Wardway and Ward's Cast Iron
      </p>
      <p>
        The "Magnalite" line of cast aluminum products was introduced in the
        early 1930s, made from a patented aluminum alloy. The company employed
        the industrial designer John Gordon Rideout to overhaul the design of
        Wagner's products in an effort to counter falling sales during the Great
        Depression. In 1933 Rideout and his partner Harold Van Doren designed
        a Magnalite teakettle with varying thickness to maximize heat
        conductivity, and in 1934 they designed an Magnalite aluminum covered
        casserole for Wagner.

        Starting in 1946 the heirs of the founding Wagner brothers divested
        their holdings in the company. The Randall Company of Cincinnati,
        Ohio, a car parts manufacturer, bought the Wagner Manufacturing Company
        in 1952.
      </p>
      <h3>Post-acquisition</h3>
      <p>
        In 1957 Randall's Wagner division acquired Griswold Manufacturing from
        McGraw-Edison. In 1959 Randall was itself acquired by Textron. Textron
        sold the Wagner and Griswold lines to General Housewares Corporation
        (GHC) in 1969. In 1996 GHC sold rights to the Wagner and Griswold
        lines to Slyman Group. After being allowed to fall into receivership,
        the Wagner factory and Wagner and Griswold trademarks were bought by the
        American Culinary Corporation of Willoughby, Ohio. As of 2014
        American Culinary continued to market products branded Wagner,
        Wagnerware, Magnalite and Griswold. The Wagner and Griswold brands
        are highly valued by collectors.
